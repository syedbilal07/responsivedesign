		<p>You've got me wide open, wide open.
				Now I'm yours.
				You found me heartbroken, heartbroken.
				On the floor.
				[Brian:]
				Became my salvation, salvation.
				Through the mourn, yeah.
				You got me wide open, wide open.
				Now I'm sure.
				In a world like this where some back down.
				I, I, know we're gonna make it.
				In a time like this where love comes 'round.
				I, I, know we're gonna take it.
				In a world like this where people fall apart.
				In a time like this where nothing comes from the heart.
				In a world like this,
				[AJ:] I've got you.
				And now I'm free falling, free falling.
				In your eyes.
				You got me still calling, still calling.
				No surprise.
				[Kevin:]
				I never knew I could love 'til the.
				End of time, yeah.
				And now I'm free falling, free falling.
				By your side.</p>
